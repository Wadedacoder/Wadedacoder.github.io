        <p class ="midleft">The Hollow Knight is the one of the final bosses in the base game. It is not a hard fight but one filled with theatrical closure. He is the one who the game is named upon , the end goal of your quest , yet you see him suffer during the fight , inflicting harm to himself and various points during the battle. It is less of a fight and more of a mercy killing. On top of this , if you beat him you are sealed in his place and do his duty. He also has a harder version known as the "Pure Vessel" in which you fight him as an equal like the brother he was.</p>
