        <p2 class="text-white ">First, I would like to thank the teachers for allowing such high quality courses to be free on the internet. As we are allowed to make our website regarding anything I decided to make one about Hollow Knight. It is a game I found during my lowest points and has been accompanying me ever since.</p2>
        <p class="text-light">Hollow Knight is an epic 2D action-adventure where a courageous hero explores twisting caverns, battle tainted creatures and escape intricate traps, to solve an ancient long-hidden mystery. Featuring hand-drawn art and a compelling music score, players engage in intense acrobatic combat as well as challenging platforming to reach their goals and achieve the multiple endings of the game.</p>
